# BATTLESNAKE 2018
## A Battlesnake competition AI written in Python! (With gUnicorn, gEvent and Flask!)

To run this AI:
  1. Register with Heroku
  2. Make a copy of this repo and aim your Heroku project at it (see settings in the Heroku app)
  3. Aim the Battlesnake client at the app's URL
### Depending on the client's config, the URL might need to NOT have the '/' at the end.
